Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n",

The wholesale shops are the ones which sell the product in large quantity and at lower price while the retail shops are the one which sell things directly to customers which means the shop sells low quantity and at a higher price. On the basis of this logic, we make out that we need to have different average order value for each type of shops.\n",
